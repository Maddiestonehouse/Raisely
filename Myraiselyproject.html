  <h1> My Raisely Project Questions and Answers </h1>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="onea"> <h2> Question One <a name="questionone"> </a> </h2> </div>
    <div class="oneb"> <h3> Why would you be a good fit for the Customer Success Specialist role? </h3> </div>
    <div class="onec"> <img class="explosions" src="../desktop/explosions.jpg"> </div>
    <div class="oned"> <p> Reading this application today, I feel I have found what I am looking for.
       I've recently picked up basic HTML, CSS, Javascript coding, after dabbling in it here and there over the last couple of years.
       By trade, I'm a fully registered Science and Maths Secondary School teacher.
       I love working with others, especially when it involves an element of learning, and I'm looking for my next challenge in life.
       I think I would be a good fit for this role because everything you have mentioned that you want sounds like you are describing me!
       For an example, as soon as I saw the advertisement for this role, I set out on a non-stop endeavour to get my HTML page done and dusted.
       I love the logical problem-solving element of coding, and I'm always willing to learn new things to improve my skills.
       I also enjoy working in a team setting, and having meaningful communication with others, especially when there is a common goal in mind. I love to make resources, and I think I would really enjoy the writing aspect of support articles.  </p> </div>
  </div>

  <div class="gridtwo">
    <div class="twoa"> <h2> Question Two <a name="questiontwo"> </a> </h2> </div>
    <div class="twob"> <h3> Why do you want to work here over somewhere else? </h3> </div>
    <div class="twoc"> <img class="timo" src="../desktop/maddieandtimo.jpg"> </div>
    <div class="twod"> <p> I'm looking for work where I can develop a skill in coding while also communicating with others, and contributing to the planet in a positive way.
                           I think that Raisely enables charity websites to maximise their presence online which in-turn generates more income for the charities.
                           Raisely is something I know I can get behind. I know I would feel like I was contributing to a more positive world working for your company.  </p> </div>

  <div class="gridthree">
    <div class="threea"> <h2> Question Three <a name="questionthree"> </a> </h2> </div>
    <div class="threeb"> <h3> Looking at <a href="https://gist.github.com/tommaitland/193b189f80d15309f4bfc475a3a7e81e" class=""> this </a>
         list of tasks, tell us which two you are excited by, which two you want to learn and the two you don’t want to do. </h3> </div>
    <div class="threec">
      <p class="fire"> The two I am excited by: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Running a training webinar </li>
          <li> Writing a new support article on how to optimise your donation form </li>
        </ul>

      <p class="fire"> The two I want to learn: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Updating the developer docs to cover a new release </li>
          <li> Working with developers to debug and resolve a product issue </li>
        </ul>

      <p class="fire"> The two I don't want to do (but really, they all sound like fun): <p>
        <ul>
          <li> Changing the fonts and background colour on someone's campaign </li>
          <li> Creating engaging content for social media and digital marketing </li>
      </ul> </p>

    <div class="fourc"> <img class="award" src="../desktop/awardforcelogo.jpg"> </div>
    <div class="fourd"> <p> I know that Award Force is a platform that is very similar to Raisely in many ways.
                         Award Force is an awards-management SaaS platform which originated in Sydney.
                         Their success team is motivated and dedicated to their clients when it comes to getting the most out of their software.
                         Clients are encouraged to request consultations and questions are answers within hours. It also has a 66 NPS which is comparable to some of the leading companies in the world such as Apple.  </p> </div>
